## Project Overview

This project analyzes sales trends, promotional effects, category performance, seasonal patterns, and inflation impacts to develop a clear inventory optimization strategy. The goal is to help retailers maintain the right stock levels, reduce shortages, avoid overstocking, and align inventory with customer demand.

## Objective

Identify the key factors influencing inventory efficiency and develop actionable recommendations that support accurate stocking decisions and operational improvement.

## Problem Statement

Retailers often face:

- Excess stock of slow-moving items

- Stockouts for high-demand products

- Misalignment with promotional cycles

- Limited visibility into true product performance

- Scattered or inconsistent data

This project provides a structured approach to solving these issues.

# Methodology

### 1. Data Extraction and Cleaning

- Queried category-level sales data using SQL

- Compared promotional and non-promotional performance

- Assessed impact of inflation

- Evaluated seasonal patterns

- Standardized and cleaned the dataset for accurate analysis

### 2. Analysis

- Ranked product categories by sales volume

- Identified categories dependent on promotions

- Studied year-round stability for key categories

- Determined where inflation or seasonality had limited influence

- Calculated average annual sales to establish reliable benchmarks

### 3. Strategy Development

- Converted findings into recommendations focused on:

- Stock prioritization

- Promotional inventory planning

- Forecasting

- Customer satisfaction

- Waste reduction

# Key Insights

### 1. Electronics

Consistently the highest-performing category. Demand remains strong regardless of season, inflation, or promotions. Electronics require consistently high stock levels.

### 2. Home Appliances

Highly dependent on promotions. Inventory planning must align with promotional schedules to avoid overstocking during non-promotional periods.

### 3. Smartphones and Laptops

Stable, predictable demand throughout the year. Require steady, balanced inventory levels.

### 4. Seasonal Factors

Seasonality has limited influence on most categories. Seasonal adjustments must be category-specific, not universal.

# Recommendations

- Prioritize Electronics inventory to meet consistently strong demand.

- Increase Home Appliances inventory during promotional periods and scale back afterward.

- Maintain steady, balanced stock levels for Smartphones and Laptops.

- Use average annual sales as the primary benchmark for demand planning.

- Improve product availability to increase customer satisfaction and reduce lost sales.

# Tools and Technologies

- SQL

- Excel

- Power BI

- Tableau

- Data cleaning and ETL principles

- Trend and correlation analysis

# Key Takeaways

Effective inventory management requires accurate data, category-specific strategies, and consistent review of sales behavior. Electronics should be stocked heavily. Home Appliances require promotion-driven planning. Smartphones and Laptops need stable, year-round inventory. Strategic stocking reduces waste, prevents shortages, and improves business performance.
